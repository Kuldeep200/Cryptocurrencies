Cryptocurrencies

In this project, unsupervised machine learning is used to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report classifying the traded cryptocurrencies by group according to their features. This report can be used by investment banks to identify the traded cryptocurrencies.



  We use the following methods for the analysis:

    preprocessing the database,
    reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis,
    clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means,
    visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.
